## ML-engineer

</div>

My journey into **IT** started in **2018**, when I began studying at **Don State Technical University**. Currently :mortar_board:, I am enrolled in the course **"Neural Network Developer"**, where I am learning about the latest developments in the field :computer:. I am also working on improving my English skills, and my current level is **B1** :books:.

**My goal** is to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of machine learning  :bulb:. ML arouses my great interest and desire to grow in this direction. I have many interesting repositories that can be viewed in my profile. It will be interesting for me to discuss them with you and get your assessment :memo:!

## Main projects

</div>

### üìå Neuro employee with LangChain

I have created a chatbot based on neural networks that can answer customer questions, solve their problems, and provide information about the products and services offered by our online store. The chatbot uses a token counting algorithm to help save money and avoid using **OpenAI**. 

**Tehnology Stack: LangChain, Gradio and ChromaDB**.

----------

### üìå Technical consultant in the RAG system

I created a neuro-employee with the profession of a technical consultant in the form of a **RAG system**. He is able to respond to user queries by getting information from the knowledge base - a Google document, as well as filtering the output data. For a more correct and better operation of the **RAG system**, the following approaches have been implemented to solve the problem of "**pain points**":

 - **Pain point 1:** missing content (implemented data cleanup and   
   improvement of prompts);
 - **Pain point 4:** Handling Inconsistencies in Retrieved Information;
 - **Pain point 8:** Scalability of the received data;
 - **Pain Point 12:** LLM security (**NeMo Guardrails**).

**Tehnology Stack: LlamaIndex, HuggingFaceLLM and Phoenix**.

### üìå Regression task with Optuna

I have completed the task of predicting the cost of Japanese cars using regression. For this purpose, I used technology to create features based on available data and select optimal hyperparameters with **Optuna**. The average absolute percentage error has decreased to 0.42% as a result.   

**Tehnology Stack: Keras, Numpy and Optuna**.

### üìå EfficientNetV2 dataset Stanford Dogs

Work was carried out on the classification of dog images using the **EfficientNetV2** method and image augmentation, which allowed to increase the amount of data for training the model and achieve an accuracy of 86%. 

**Tehnology Stack: TensorFlow, EfficientNetV2B0, Numpy and Matplotlib**.

----------

### üìå Embedding LSTM GRU

A model has been created that allows us to determine which of the Russian writers is most suitable for the presented text in terms of presentation style. The model uses two types of recurrent layers ‚Äî **LSTM** and **GRU**, as well as a pre-trained **Embedding layer**. This made it possible to achieve an accuracy of 91%. 

**Tehnology Stack: Keras, Numpy, Razdel and Matplotlib**.
