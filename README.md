## Junior ML-engineer

My journey into IT started in 2018, when I began studying at Don State Technical University. Currently, I am enrolled in the course "Neural Network Developer", where I am learning about the latest developments in the field. I am also working on improving my English skills, and my current level is B1.

My goal is to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of machine learning. ML arouses my great interest and desire to grow in this direction. I have many interesting repositories that can be viewed in my profile. It will be interesting for me to discuss them with you and get your assessment!
