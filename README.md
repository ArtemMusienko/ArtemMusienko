My journey into **IT** started in **2018**, when I began studying at **Don State Technical University**. Currently :mortar_board:, I am enrolled in the course **"Neural Network Developer"**, where I am learning about the latest developments in the field :computer:. I am also working on improving my English skills, and my current level is **B1** :books:.

**My goal** is to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of machine learning  :bulb:. ML arouses my great interest and desire to grow in this direction. I have many interesting repositories that can be viewed in my profile. It will be interesting for me to discuss them with you and get your assessment :memo:!

## Main projects

</div>

### 📌 YOLOv8 vehicle detection

I have developed the **YOLOv8** model to detect vehicles in low light conditions. To improve recognition accuracy, the model is trained on specially prepared images that simulate different levels of illumination. This allows you to improve object recognition in real conditions. The dataset structure is flexible: in addition to augmented data, you can include original images, which will positively affect the quality of the model. Additional tests were also conducted and optimization techniques were applied, which significantly improved code performance.

**Tehnology Stack: YOLOv8, OpenCV and albumentations**.

### 📌 OpenRouter chat authorization

I have developed a chat application that integrates with OpenRouter.ai , providing unified access to dozens of powerful artificial intelligence models using a single API key. The application supports PIN-based secure login and API key protection, automatic loading of available models at startup, a searchable drop-down list for selecting a model, real-time account balance display, and full compatibility with OpenAI query formats for smooth switching between vendors without changing the code. This setting is ideal for testing, comparing models, and making effective use of free-tier constraints.

**Technology Stack: Python, OpenRouter API.**

### 📌 Technical consultant in the RAG system

I created a neuro-employee with the profession of a technical consultant in the form of a **RAG system**. He is able to respond to user queries by getting information from the knowledge base - a Google document, as well as filtering the output data. For a more correct and better operation of the **RAG system**, the following approaches have been implemented to solve the problem of "**pain points**":

 - **Pain point 1:** missing content (implemented data cleanup and   
   improvement of prompts);
 - **Pain point 4:** Handling Inconsistencies in Retrieved Information (a content resorter was used);
 - **Pain point 8:** Scalability of the received data (parallel processing is used);
 - **Pain Point 12:** LLM security (**NeMo Guardrails**).

**Tehnology Stack: LlamaIndex, HuggingFaceLLM and Phoenix**.

### 📌 BipedalWalker v3 with DDPQ and PPO

For the BipedalWalker v3 gaming environment, I have developed two learning methods: DDPQ and PPO. The study identified the most effective method for this environment — DDPQ. This approach demonstrated the best learning outcomes and showed positive dynamics on the graph.

**Tehnology Stack: PyTorch, gymnasium, DDPQ and PPO**.

----------

### 📌 RL-MsPacman-v5

I have implemented Reinforcement Learning (RL). The following "ALE/MsPacman-v5" option was chosen as the game and its version. To demonstrate the work of this approach, two algorithms were chosen, namely: a random search strategy and a climbing algorithm to the top. The best algorithm for this environment has been determined and the best result is displayed as a GIF format.

**Tehnology Stack: gymnasium, PyTorch, random search strategy and climbing algorithm to the top**.

### 📌 Neuro employee with LangChain

I have created a chatbot based on neural networks that can answer customer questions, solve their problems, and provide information about the products and services offered by our online store. The chatbot uses a token counting algorithm to help save money and avoid using **OpenAI**. 

**Tehnology Stack: LangChain, Gradio and ChromaDB**.

[**Link to the project.**](https://github.com/ArtemMusienko/Neuro-employee-with-LangChain)

----------

### 📌 ROBERTA-large classification

I have developed a class prediction system based on a dataset with news. I chose ai-forever/ruRoberta-large, which belongs to the BERT family, as the model. Before training the model, I performed filtering and preprocessing of the data. These steps have significantly improved the quality of the model's predictions.

**Tehnology Stack: ROBERTA, sklearn, TensorFlow, Keras and Numpy**.
