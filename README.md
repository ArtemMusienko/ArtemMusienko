## ML-engineer

</div>

My journey into **IT** started in **2018**, when I began studying at **Don State Technical University**. Currently :mortar_board:, I am enrolled in the course **"Neural Network Developer"**, where I am learning about the latest developments in the field :computer:. I am also working on improving my English skills, and my current level is **B1** :books:.

**My goal** is to become a highly qualified specialist in the field of machine learning  :bulb:. ML arouses my great interest and desire to grow in this direction. I have many interesting repositories that can be viewed in my profile. It will be interesting for me to discuss them with you and get your assessment :memo:!

## Main projects

</div>

### üìå YOLOv8 vehicle detection

I have developed the **YOLOv8** model to detect vehicles in low light conditions. To improve recognition accuracy, the model is trained on specially prepared images that simulate different levels of illumination. This allows you to improve object recognition in real conditions. The dataset structure is flexible: in addition to augmented data, you can include original images, which will positively affect the quality of the model. Additional tests were also conducted and optimization techniques were applied, which significantly improved code performance.

**Tehnology Stack: YOLOv8, OpenCV and albumentations**.

### üìå BipedalWalker v3 with DDPQ and PPO

For the BipedalWalker v3 gaming environment, I have developed two learning methods: DDPQ and PPO. The study identified the most effective method for this environment ‚Äî DDPQ. This approach demonstrated the best learning outcomes and showed positive dynamics on the graph.

**Tehnology Stack: PyTorch, gymnasium, DDPQ and PPO**.

### üìå Technical consultant in the RAG system

I created a neuro-employee with the profession of a technical consultant in the form of a **RAG system**. He is able to respond to user queries by getting information from the knowledge base - a Google document, as well as filtering the output data. For a more correct and better operation of the **RAG system**, the following approaches have been implemented to solve the problem of "**pain points**":

 - **Pain point 1:** missing content (implemented data cleanup and   
   improvement of prompts);
 - **Pain point 4:** Handling Inconsistencies in Retrieved Information;
 - **Pain point 8:** Scalability of the received data;
 - **Pain Point 12:** LLM security (**NeMo Guardrails**).

**Tehnology Stack: LlamaIndex, HuggingFaceLLM and Phoenix**.

### üìå Neuro employee with LangChain

I have created a chatbot based on neural networks that can answer customer questions, solve their problems, and provide information about the products and services offered by our online store. The chatbot uses a token counting algorithm to help save money and avoid using **OpenAI**. 

**Tehnology Stack: LangChain, Gradio and ChromaDB**.

### üìå English Portuguese Translator

I have implemented an English-Portuguese translator based on a recurrent autoencoder. The BPE tokenizer is used to improve translation quality, which is especially useful for processing rare words and languages with rich morphology.

**Tehnology Stack: Autoencoder, Tensorflow, Keras and BPE tokenization**.
